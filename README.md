** DANGEROUS SOUNDS WARNING **
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2 many channels at once WILL distort, so tread careful and manage volumes with SndVol.exe \m/. Limit channels to avoid distortion.

Each cell in your grid represents a sound channel, limiting the number of channels manages polyphony. In drumOMATA the grid position represents a slice of the provided loop.wav (replace loop.wav with yr own). In synthOMATA each position is a sinewave. There is a threshold condition modulating volume per channel. Each FRAME is a generation and equates to TIME.

To leave the grid, simply 'ESC'ape.
